# FizzBuzzTDD

This is a FizzBuzz operator that prints 'Fizz' for multiples of 3, 'Buzz' for multiples of 5 and 'FizzBuzz' for multiples of 3 and 5. It also prints the original numbers that are not part of this sequence.

This operation has been created with testable code, that has been fully tested using TDD. It ensures that all the outputs of every function are tested. This includes testing where you expect all the numbers to be in a array (ranging from 1 to 100) and also an element in the array being expected to equal (eq) 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz' or the number if none.

### TDD
TDD is Test Driven Developement. it includes 3 stages:
1. RED (Write a test that fails)
2. GREEN (Write a test that passes)
3. REFACTOR (Change code for better, by ensuring its the most efficient)
